KNEE IDENTIFICATION (heuristic: largest slope drop)
knee_latency_ns=81.62
knee_throughput_MBps=27727.77
knee_effective_outstanding_requests≈35.36
knee_percent_of_measured_peak≈69.8%

Little's Law tie-in:
  L = λ·W, with λ ≈ BW/bytes_per_request.
  Here bytes/request ≈ 64 B.
  Before the knee, increasing intensity raises λ (higher BW) while W ~ service time.
  After the knee, BW saturates; further intensity inflates W (queuing),
  so L grows mostly via latency, showing diminishing returns.
