# Project 3: Approximate Membership Filters (Bloom, XOR, Cuckoo, Quotient)

## 1. Introduction
Approximate membership structures answer the question “is x probably in the set?” far faster and smaller than exact indexes.  
This project implements and analyzes four such filters — Bloom, XOR, Cuckoo, and Quotient — each offering distinct trade-offs between space, throughput, and dynamic capability.  

Experiments quantify bits per entry vs. false positive rate, lookup throughput and latency tails, insert/delete throughput, and thread scaling.  
Results are interpreted in the context of theoretical expectations for load factor, memory locality, cache/TLB behavior, and contention effects.

### General Methodology

All experiments were conducted using a unified, fully automated benchmarking pipeline developed for Project A3.  
This methodology ensures fairness, reproducibility, and statistical rigor across all filters and experiment types.

---

#### **1. Pipeline Overview**

- **Central Orchestration**
  - The top-level controller `project_manager.py` coordinates build, test, experiment, and plot operations.  
  - Supported modes:
    - `--mode=build`  → compile all binaries via CMake  
    - `--mode=test`   → run correctness tests for each filter  
    - `--mode=experiment` → launch managed experiment sweeps (`space`, `lookup`, `insert`, `threads`, or `all`)  
    - `--mode=plot`   → generate plots from aggregated results  
  - Automatically forwards CLI parameters (filters, FPRs, thread counts, workloads, repetitions, warm/cold flag) to downstream modules.

- **Experiment Scripts**
  - `experiment_manager.py` runs sweeps and maintains standardized directories:  
    - `results/<experiment>/<timestamp>/results.csv`  – raw experimental data from `bench.cpp`  
    - `results/<experiment>/<timestamp>/summary.csv` – aggregated mean ± std metrics  
    - `results/<experiment>/<timestamp>/plots/` – figures created by `plot_manager.py`  
  - Aggregation logic varies by experiment to create clear and concise summary tables.  
  - `plot_manager.py` parses the data from the aggregated csv and creates clean plots of the significant data depending on the experiment run.

- **Executable Layer**
  - The C++ benchmark harness `bench.cpp` provides all performance measurements.  
  - The bench manages parameters and setup for each experiment mode (`space`, `lookup`, `insert`, `threads`).  
  - Every run is CPU-pinned via `taskset` to eliminate cross-core interference and stabilize cache behavior.
  - Output data is read into the raw `results.csv`.

---

#### **2. Data Management & Repetition Protocol**

- **Repetitions**
  - Each configuration is executed ≥ 3 times (default `--reps 3`) to capture run-to-run variance.
    - Final trials used `--reps 10` for higher accuracy.  
  - Reported values are mean ± standard deviation.  
  - `SMOKE=1` enables reduced parameter sets for fast validation.

- **Warm-Up & Cache State**
  - A configurable warm-up pass (`--warm=1`) primes caches and branch predictors before timing.  
  - Warm mode is the default; cold runs are available for contrast.

- **Key Generation**
  - Random 64-bit keys via `std::mt19937_64` with independent seeds per repetition.  
  - Positive and negative key sets are non-overlapping and uniformly shuffled.

- **Data Logging & Output**
  - Each run creates a self-contained folder with:
    - `stdout.log`, `stderr.log` — raw execution logs  
    - `results.csv` — raw per-trial metrics  
    - `summary.csv` — grouped aggregates (mean/std)  
    - `plots/*.png` — labeled figures with error bars  
  - All result directories are timestamped for traceability and reproducibility.

---

#### **3. Metrics Captured**

- **Space vs Accuracy**
  - Target FPR sweep (0.1% → 5%)
  - Bits per entry (including metadata)  
  - Achieved FPR  
  - Build time (ms)

- **Lookup Throughput & Tail Latency**  
  - Negative-lookup share sweep (0 → 90%)
  - Queries per second (QPS)  
  - Latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99 in ns)

- **Insert/Delete Throughput (Dynamic Filters)**
  - Load factor sweep (0.4 → 0.95)
  - Insert / delete operations per second  
  - **Cuckoo:** insertion failure rate, evictions, stash hits  
  - **Quotient:** average probe length, cluster-length distribution (histogram)

- **Thread Scaling**
  - Thread count sweep (1 → 16)  
  - Workload mixes: balanced & read-mostly
  - Throughput (ops/s)
  - Contention-point markers (first ≥ 20% drop from ideal linear scaling)

---

#### **4. Statistical Aggregation & Plotting**

- **Aggregation**
  - Performed in Python (`pandas` + `NumPy`) with grouped mean and standard deviation by configuration.  
  - Compact summaries saved as `summary.csv` (experiment-specific schemas).

- **Visualization**
  - `plot_manager.py` auto-detects `_mean` / `_std` columns and adds error bars.  
  - Unified styling:
    - **Space vs Accuracy** — log-scaled FPR vs BPE with a theoretical Bloom curve.  
    - **Lookup** — throughput curve + p50/p95/p99 latency subplots per filter.  
    - **Insert/Delete** — throughput, failure rate, probe lengths, and histogram.  
    - **Thread Scaling** — balanced & read-mostly subplots with triangle markers for contention points.

---

#### **5. Validation & Reproducibility**

- **Correctness Verification**
  - Each filter passes a `test_filters` suite prior to experiments:
    - Positive/negative set checks  
    - Target FPR verification  
    - Insert/delete integrity for dynamic filters

- **Controlled Execution Environment**
  - Identical OS/compiler/affinity settings across runs (CPU pinning via `taskset`).  
  - Seeds, CLI parameters, and system metadata logged for full re-execution.  
  - `python3 project_manager.py --mode=experiment --exp all` regenerates the complete pipeline end-to-end.

## 2. Filters

This section outlines the design and implementation of each approximate membership filter used in this project.  
All filters share a common interface (`insert`, `contains`, `finalize`, and optional `remove` for dynamic variants) and rely on a **unified hashing layer** implemented in `hash_utils.h` using 64-bit xxHash for high speed and reproducibility.  
Each filter is parameterized by:
- **n:** target number of elements  
- **fpr:** desired false positive rate  
- **seed:** base hash seed for reproducibility  

---

### **2.1 Blocked Bloom Filter**
**File(s):** `filters/bloom.cpp`, `filters/bloom.h`  
**Type:** Baseline (insert + query; no delete)

- **Core Idea:**  
  Implements the classical Bloom filter with Kirsch–Mitzenmacher double hashing for efficient multi-hash simulation.  
  The bit array is rounded up to 64-bit word boundaries for alignment and pre-touched during construction to stabilize page-fault latency.

- **Construction Details:**
  - Target bits per element computed as:  
    $$ m = -\frac{n \ln(fpr)}{(\ln 2)^2} $$
  - Number of hash functions:  
    $$ k = \text{round}\left(\frac{m}{n} \ln 2\right) $$
  - Bits stored in a `std::vector<uint64_t>`; each bit toggled by two base hashes $h_1, h_2$:  
    $$ index_i = (h_1 + i \times h_2) \bmod m $$
  - The `finalize()` method is a no-op since no post-processing is required.

- **Advantages:**
  - Very fast construction and lookup.
  - High cache locality through contiguous bit storage.

- **Limitations:**
  - No deletion support.  
  - Moderate space inefficiency due to lack of block partitioning and metadata overhead.

---

### **2.2 XOR Filter**
**File(s):** `filters/xor.cpp`, `filters/xor.h`  
**Type:** Static (build-time only)

- **Core Idea:**  
  A peeling-based static filter where each key maps to three candidate slots via independent hash seeds.  
  The structure stores XOR fingerprints such that membership queries can reconstruct expected fingerprints with three lookups.

- **Build Process:**
  - Fingerprint width (8–16 bits) determined by target FPR:  
    $$ f_{bits} = \lceil \log_2(1/fpr) \rceil + 1 $$
  - Uses a random 3-hypergraph peeling process:
    1. Construct degree counts for all vertices (table slots).
    2. Repeatedly peel degree-1 vertices, recording edge-order.
    3. Assign fingerprints in reverse order using XOR constraints.
  - Multiple independent build attempts (≤ 6) ensure convergence under unlucky seeds.
  - Overprovisioned table (`~1.23×n`) ensures successful peel with high probability.

- **Query Path:**
  1. Compute three indices $h_1, h_2, h_3$.  
  2. XOR fingerprints from those slots.  
  3. Compare result to computed fingerprint of query key.

- **Advantages:**
  - Superior space efficiency (approaching 8–10 bits per entry at 1 % FPR).  
  - Fast lookups with three predictable memory reads.

- **Limitations:**
  - Static: requires full rebuild on key changes.  
  - Build step more expensive than dynamic insertions.

---

### **2.3 Cuckoo Filter**
**File(s):** `filters/cuckoo.cpp`, `filters/cuckoo.h`  
**Type:** Dynamic (supports insert, query, delete)

- **Core Idea:**  
  Extends standard Cuckoo hashing to store fingerprints instead of full keys.  
  Each key has two candidate buckets; if both are full, entries are evicted and relocated (bounded kick-out chain).  
  Small stash mitigates worst-case insertion failures.

- **Design Details:**
  - Bucket size: 4 slots (`BUCKET_SIZE = 4`).  
  - Target load factor ≈ 0.7, adjusted dynamically with FPR.  
  - Fingerprint width = ⌈ log₂(2 × bucket_size / FPR) ⌉, clamped to 8–16 bits.  
  - Alternate bucket computed as:
    $$ i_2 = i_1 \oplus (hash(fp) \bmod N) $$
  - Eviction loop capped (`MAX_KICKS ≈ 1000 × log₂ N`) to avoid livelock.

- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Eviction attempts (`m_eviction_attempts`)  
  - Stash insertions (`m_stash_hits`)  
  - Failed inserts (`m_failed_inserts`)  

- **Advantages:**
  - Supports deletion and dynamic resizing behavior.  
  - Compact; nearly Bloom-equivalent false positive rates with fewer memory accesses.

- **Limitations:**
  - Performance degrades near saturation.  
  - Slightly higher metadata overhead due to bucketization.

---

### **2.4 Quotient Filter**
**File(s):** `filters/quotient.cpp`, `filters/quotient.h`  
**Type:** Dynamic (supports insert, query, delete)

- **Core Idea:**  
  Stores keys by splitting their hashes into a quotient (bucket index) and remainder (fingerprint).  
  Each bucket’s run of elements is stored contiguously with metadata bits indicating structure (`occupied`, `shifted`, `continuation`).  
  This design achieves high cache locality and predictable scan behavior.

- **Implementation Highlights:**
  - Hash $h$ divided into:
    $$ q = h \gg rbits, \quad r = h \,\&\, ((1 \ll rbits) - 1) $$
  - Table capacity is rounded to power-of-two (`capacity = 2^qbits`).  
  - Insertion shifts elements right to maintain sorted, contiguous runs.  
  - Deletion simply clears slot; compaction omitted for simplicity.  
  - Metadata per slot:
    - `shifted`: stored away from canonical bucket  
    - `continuation`: not first in run  
    - `occupied[q]`: indicates run presence for bucket q  

- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Average probe length (successful insert distance)  
  - Cluster length distribution (histogram up to 64 slots)  
  - Max cluster length (longest contiguous run)  

- **Advantages:**
  - Fully dynamic with delete support.  
  - Cache-friendly contiguous storage and simple arithmetic indexing.  
  - Fine-grained introspection via cluster histograms.

- **Limitations:**
  - More complex insertion logic and metadata handling.  
  - Slightly higher constant factors compared to Cuckoo filter at low load.

---

### **2.5 Hashing Layer**
**File:** `filters/hash_utils.h`

- Provides a common, high-speed, non-cryptographic hash API using xxHash64.  
- Distinct seeds are derived for each hash variant and per filter instance to ensure statistical independence:
  - `hash64(key, seed)` — primary 64-bit hash  
  - `multi_hash64(key, base_seed, out[3])` — produce three independent hashes for XOR and Bloom filters  
- Guarantees consistent reproducibility across runs and identical hash distributions for all filters.

---

**Summary:**  
Together, these four filters represent a continuum of design trade-offs:  
Bloom (simple and dense) → XOR (static but ultra-compact) → Cuckoo (dynamic and balanced) → Quotient (structured and cache-aware).  
All implementations adhere to a common interface for direct comparability under identical workloads and instrumentation.

## 3. Experiments
### **3.1 Space vs Accuracy**
#### **Purpose**
Evaluate the space efficiency of each filter by measuring bits per entry (BPE) against the achieved false positive rate (FPR) across several targets.  
This experiment quantifies how closely each implementation approaches the theoretical Bloom lower bound, highlighting both algorithmic efficiency and metadata overhead.

#### **Methodology**
- **Experiment mode:**  
  Executed with `--exp=space` using `n = 1,000,000` keys per trial.

- **Parameters tested:**  
  - Target FPRs: 5%, 1%, 0.1%  
  - Filters: Bloom, XOR, Cuckoo, Quotient  

- **Procedure:**  
  - Each trial generates disjoint positive and negative key sets.  
  - Filters are constructed with the target FPR, populated with positive keys, and finalized.  
  - Negative keys are probed to measure the achieved FPR.  
  - BPE is computed as total bits used (table + metadata) divided by the number of inserted keys.  
  - Build time is recorded for reference.

- **Metrics reported:**  
  - Achieved FPR (empirical error rate)  
  - Bits per entry (BPE) including metadata  
  - Build time (ms) 
  - Reported with error bars showing variation across repetitions

- **Output summary:**  
  Results are averaged by `(filter, target_fpr)` and visualized on a log-scale plot of FPR vs. BPE,  
  with the Bloom theoretical limit included as a dashed reference curve.

#### **Results**
**Figure 3.1.1: Space vs Accuracy**
![Space vs Accuracy](results/space_vs_accuracy/2025-10-24_14-49-21/plots/space_vs_accuracy.png)

#### **Analysis**
- **General trends:**  
  - All filters show the expected inverse relationship between FPR and BPE — as tighter accuracy targets are imposed, space usage increases.  
  - The plot also includes the theoretical Bloom bound (black dashed line), providing a baseline for optimal space efficiency.  
  - Error bars representing 10 independent repetitions are included but appear invisible at this scale, indicating very low variance across runs (<0.5% deviation).

- **Bloom filter:**  
  - Closely tracks the theoretical limit across all FPRs, within ~10–15% overhead.  
  - This confirms the correctness of the implementation and validates the baseline for comparison.  
  - Minor deviation above theory is expected due to the integer quantization of hash functions (`k = round(m/n * ln(2))`) and metadata bookkeeping.

- **XOR filter:**  
  - Achieves the lowest overall BPE among all filters, with 8–10 bits per entry at 1% FPR.  
  - Consistent with theory, XOR filters approach the information-theoretic minimum by storing only compact fingerprints and avoiding per-bit metadata.  
  - Efficiency improves slightly as FPR tightens, reflecting how XOR construction amortizes the overhead of empty slots across a denser key set.  
  - The small gap relative to the Bloom bound arises from the fingerprint alignment to 8/16-bit boundaries, introducing rounding inefficiencies.

- **Cuckoo filter:**  
  - Occupies the middle ground between Bloom and Quotient filters.  
  - Shows predictable scaling, requiring ~7 bits more per entry than Bloom at 1% FPR.  
  - The excess space comes primarily from bucketization overhead (4-slot buckets, 2 candidate indices) and internal stashing metadata.  
  - Its slope roughly parallels Bloom’s theoretical curve, confirming that most of the growth is fundamental rather than implementation-induced.

- **Quotient filter:**  
  - The least space-efficient, averaging 25–35 bits per entry across tested FPRs.  
  - Overhead is dominated by metadata bits per slot (`occupied`, `continuation`, `shifted`) and variable cluster lengths, which scale non-linearly with load factor.  
  - Despite poorer compression, the results remain internally consistent, confirming that the implementation maintains expected structural correctness.

- **Comparative efficiency:**  
  - At 1% FPR, relative efficiency (normalized to theoretical Bloom) is approximately:  
    - XOR: 1.1× theoretical limit  
    - Bloom: 1.2×  
    - Cuckoo: 1.7×  
    - Quotient: 3.0×  
  - These ratios align with published literature and confirm expected orderings of compactness vs. flexibility.

- **Observed stability:**  
  - Across all filters and FPRs, achieved false positive rates remained within ±0.05% of targets, validating that each implementation correctly tunes internal parameters.  
  - The low standard deviations across 10 runs demonstrate high determinism in both hashing and build phases.

Overall, the Space vs Accuracy experiment confirms theoretical expectations:  
static filters (Bloom, XOR) achieve near-optimal density, while dynamic structures (Cuckoo, Quotient) trade additional space for insertion and deletion capability.  
The close match between measured and theoretical scaling curves suggests that all four implementations are functionally correct and well-parameterized, with negligible experimental noise.

### **3.2 Lookup Throughput & Tail Latency**
#### **Purpose**
Measure the query performance of each filter under varying fractions of negative lookups, capturing both average throughput (QPS) and tail latency (p50, p95, p99).  
This experiment quantifies how lookup cost scales with query composition and evaluates how each structure’s memory locality and false-positive handling impact latency distribution.  
Together, these results illustrate the trade-off between throughput efficiency and worst-case latency as negative queries become more dominant.

#### **Methodology**
- **Experiment mode:**  
  Executed with `--exp=lookup` to measure per-query latency and overall throughput for each filter.

- **Parameters tested:**  
  - Negative lookup ratios: 0.0, 0.5, 0.9  
  - Target FPR: 1% (fixed across all filters)  
  - Filters: Bloom, XOR, Cuckoo, Quotient  
  - Threads: 1 (single-threaded)  

- **Procedure:**  
  - Each run constructs the filter with `n = 1,000,000` randomly generated keys.  
  - Independent, non-overlapping negative sets are created to control the negative ratio in query workloads.  
  - Queries are randomly mixed according to the desired negative ratio and executed in randomized order.  
  - Timing is performed using high-resolution nanosecond timers within `bench.cpp`, sampling roughly 5% of queries for latency quantiles.  
  - Warm-up passes (`--warm=1`) ensure cache and predictor stabilization prior to timing.

- **Metrics reported:**  
  - **Throughput (QPS):** total successful queries per second.  
  - **Tail latency:** p50, p95, and p99 latencies (nanoseconds).  
  - **Achieved FPR:** measured after query phase for validation.  
  - Reported with error bars (mean ± std) across repetitions.

- **Output summary:**  
  Results are grouped by `(filter, neg_ratio)`, and two visualizations are made:
   - Throughput and negative share are plotted for all filters.
   - Latency tails are visualized in a 2x2 grid of plots, with one for each filter. This preserves readability, clearly demonstrating each filter's p50, p95, and p99 as negative share increases. Furthermore, FPR is denoted via an annotation in each plot.

#### **Results**
**Figure 3.2.1: Throughput vs Negative Lookup Share**
![Throughput vs Negative Share](results/lookup_latency/2025-10-24_22-09-42/plots/lookup_throughput.png)

**Figure 3.2.2: Tail Latency by Filter**
![Tail Latency](results/lookup_latency/2025-10-24_22-09-42/plots/lookup_latency_subplots.png)

#### **Analysis**
- **General trends:**  
  - Lookup throughput and latency measurements follow expected scaling behavior across all filters.  
  - As the negative lookup ratio increases, throughput generally decreases slightly due to higher miss handling overhead, while latency distributions remain stable or slightly improve for some filters.  
  - Error bars from 10 repeated runs are included in all figures but are visually negligible — standard deviation across trials was <1%, indicating high consistency and low measurement noise.

- **Bloom filter:**  
  - Achieves the highest overall throughput, exceeding 25 million QPS for all-positive workloads.  
  - Throughput gradually declines as negative lookups dominate (to ~18 M QPS at 90% negatives).  
  - This decline is expected, as negative lookups require multiple independent hash computations that all miss, whereas positives often short-circuit after early hits.  
  - Latency remains low and consistent across all percentiles (p50 ≈ 120 ns, p99 ≈ 220 ns), demonstrating excellent uniformity and memory locality.  
  - Overall, results closely align with theoretical predictions for hash-based filters with tight bit locality.

- **XOR filter:**  
  - Throughput remains effectively flat (~19–20 M QPS) across all negative ratios, indicating minimal dependence on workload composition.  
  - The XOR structure’s constant-time query path (three fixed memory probes) explains this stability — lookup cost is independent of membership outcome.  
  - Latencies are slightly lower than Bloom’s at all percentiles (p50 ≈ 100 ns), consistent with reduced hash computation and fingerprint comparisons.  
  - Slightly higher p99 values (~180 ns) at low negative ratios are attributed to cache evictions during the initial warm-up pass.

- **Cuckoo filter:**  
  - Exhibits the lowest throughput (~0.8–0.9 M QPS) among all filters, reflecting the complexity of two-bucket lookups and fingerprint verification.  
  - Throughput marginally increases with higher negative ratios — an expected trend since negative lookups avoid eviction-related cache pollution and require no relocation logic.  
  - Latencies are notably higher (p50 ≈ 250 ns, p99 ≈ 550 ns), largely due to scattered bucket accesses and occasional L2 cache misses.  
  - Despite the performance gap, the smooth percentile curves indicate predictable access patterns and no major outliers.

- **Quotient filter:**  
  - Throughput stabilizes around 1.3–1.5 M QPS, roughly midway between Cuckoo and XOR.  
  - p50 latencies remain moderate (150–200 ns), but the p99 tail starts high (~800 ns) at 0% negatives, shrinking as the negative ratio increases.  
  - This effect stems from long probe chains when looking up present elements — as negative lookups dominate, these long linear scans become rarer, reducing worst-case latency.  
  - The shape of the latency curve validates the expected relationship between cluster length and tail performance.

- **Comparative behavior:**  
  - Bloom and XOR filters dominate in absolute throughput due to fixed, predictable memory access patterns and no per-entry metadata traversal.  
  - Cuckoo and Quotient filters, while dynamic, pay the cost of multi-slot probes and additional metadata checks.  
  - Latency tails (p95/p99) scale gently with workload composition, confirming no pathological slowdown for any filter under high negative ratios.

- **Observed stability:**  
  - Across all filters, achieved false positive rates matched their targets within ±0.1%, confirming that lookup behavior was not biased by construction anomalies.  
  - Minimal run-to-run deviation validates the reproducibility of the benchmark and the robustness of the timing instrumentation.

Overall, these results confirm expected trends:  
Bloom and XOR filters offer near-constant, cache-resident performance ideal for read-heavy static workloads, while Cuckoo and Quotient filters trade throughput and latency headroom for dynamic update capability.  
The consistent latency percentiles and near-invisible error bars indicate stable, well-optimized implementations with tightly bounded access costs across all workload compositions.

### **3.3 Insert/Delete Throughput (Dynamic Filters)**
#### **Purpose**
Evaluate the insertion and deletion performance of dynamic filters — Cuckoo and Quotient—under varying load factors.  
This experiment measures how throughput, stability, and internal metadata behavior evolve as each structure approaches capacity.  
By tracking metrics such as insertion throughput, deletion throughput, failure rate, and cluster statistics, this section characterizes the practical scalability limits and internal efficiency of dynamic designs compared to their theoretical expectations.

#### **Methodology**
- **Experiment mode:**  
  Executed with `--exp=insert` to benchmark insertion and deletion performance for dynamic filters only.

- **Parameters tested:**  
  - Filters: Cuckoo, Quotient  
  - Load factors: 0.40 → 0.95 (step = 0.05)  
  - Target FPR: 1%  
  - Elements: n = 1,000,000  
  - Repetitions: 3 trials per configuration (mean ± std reported)

- **Procedure:**  
  - Each trial constructs an empty filter sized for one million entries.  
  - The structure is prefilled to the target load factor, then insertion and deletion batches are timed separately.  
  - For Cuckoo filters: insertion failures, eviction counts, and stash hits are tracked at each load level.  
  - For Quotient filters: probe length, cluster statistics, and residual occupancy are recorded.  
  - A warm-up pass (`--warm=1`) precedes each measurement to ensure steady-state cache conditions.  
  - Deletion throughput is measured over half of the inserted items immediately following the insertion phase to capture post-fill performance.

- **Metrics reported:**  
  - **Insert throughput (ops/s)**  
  - **Delete throughput (ops/s)**  
  - **Failure rate (%)** for Cuckoo filter insertions  
  - **Average probe length**, **average cluster length**, and **max cluster length** for Quotient filter runs  
  - **Evictions** and **stash hits** for Cuckoo filters  
  - All metrics reported with error bars (mean ± std) across repetitions

- **Output summary:**  
  Results are grouped by `(filter, load_factor)`, and multiple visualizations are produced:
  - Insert and delete throughput plotted together for both filters.  
  - Cuckoo filter metrics: insertion failure rate, eviction count, and stash activity visualized separately to show stability trends.  
  - Quotient filter metrics: probe and cluster lengths plotted across load factor, with cluster-length histograms summarizing structural distribution.  
  - These plots collectively illustrate performance saturation points and structural efficiency as dynamic filters approach capacity.

  - Insert and delete performance for dynamic filters follows the expected pattern of strong mid-range throughput that degrades sharply as the table approaches saturation.  
- Both Cuckoo and Quotient filters exhibit smooth, reproducible scaling up to ~80–85% load, after which instability emerges due to collision chains and metadata saturation.  
- Error bars representing 10 repeated trials are present but visually negligible in some plots, reflecting low variance (<2%) and consistent timing results.

- **Cuckoo filter throughput (Figure 3.3.1):**  
  - Insertion throughput peaks near 0.5 load factor (~10 M ops/s), then declines steadily beyond 0.7.  
  - Deletion throughput remains stable (~6–8 M ops/s) even at higher loads, confirming low overhead for item removal.  
  - The divergence between insert and delete performance highlights the exponential cost of relocation chains once the table nears capacity.  
  - This behavior aligns with theoretical Cuckoo dynamics, where expected relocation cost grows as $1/(1-\alpha)$, with $\alpha$ the load factor.

- **Cuckoo insert failure rate (Figure 3.3.2):**  
  - Failure rate remains effectively zero through 0.85 load, then increases rapidly—exceeding 30% at 0.95 load.  
  - The sharp knee at high occupancy reflects the point where eviction chains exceed the configured bound (MAX_KICKS = 1000).  
  - This sudden onset of failures matches analytic expectations and published Cuckoo filter limits, where stable operation typically ends around 93–95% occupancy.

- **Cuckoo evictions (Figure 3.3.3):**  
  - Eviction count mirrors the failure curve: near-zero until 0.85, then grows superlinearly, exceeding 5 × 10⁷ evictions per trial by 0.95 load.  
  - Each insertion past this threshold triggers long relocation cascades across both candidate buckets, significantly inflating latency and reducing net throughput.  
  - The inflection confirms that the filter is operating beyond its sustainable load region.

- **Cuckoo stash hits (Figure 3.3.4):**  
  - Stash usage remains idle through most of the occupancy range, then spikes abruptly at 0.9 load and saturates at the maximum configured size (16 entries).  
  - This confirms correct implementation of overflow mitigation: the stash only activates when conventional eviction fails.  
  - However, the rapid saturation indicates that increasing stash capacity would provide diminishing returns—the filter’s structure itself becomes unstable near full occupancy.

- **Quotient filter throughput (Figure 3.3.1):**  
  - Insert throughput decreases monotonically with load, starting around 7 M ops/s at 0.4 and dropping below 1 M ops/s near 0.95.  
  - Deletion throughput follows a similar trend but remains consistently higher (≈ 20–30 %) due to the simpler metadata updates required for slot clearing.  
  - Unlike Cuckoo, no abrupt collapse occurs—the decline is gradual and continuous, consistent with metadata overhead rather than outright failures.

- **Quotient probe length (Figure 3.3.5):**  
  - Average probe length grows slowly until 0.85 load, then increases exponentially, exceeding 7000 slots at 0.95 occupancy.  
  - This corresponds to the clustering effect predicted by quotient-filter theory, where contiguous runs form as remainders crowd canonical buckets.  
  - The smooth but steep rise confirms that latency cost is dominated by linear scan lengths near high occupancy.

- **Quotient cluster histogram (Figure 3.3.6):**  
  - The distribution shows a heavy-tailed shape—most clusters remain under 10 slots, but a small fraction extend up to 60 slots.  
  - These long clusters explain the sharp increase in probe length and throughput decay.  
  - The histogram shape is consistent with theoretical analyses of quotient filters under high load, where cluster lengths follow a geometric distribution that skews heavily near capacity.
  - The final spike at cluster length = 64 represents the sentinel bin capturing all over-range clusters, a by-product of histogram binning rather than an actual structural anomaly.

- **Comparative behavior:**  
  - **Cuckoo filter** provides higher throughput at moderate loads but experiences abrupt instability past 90% occupancy due to runaway evictions and failed inserts.  
  - **Quotient filter** scales more gracefully and remains functional even at extreme load, but its throughput penalty grows steadily due to metadata scans and cluster expansion.  
  - Both structures exhibit strong reproducibility and smooth scaling in low to mid load regions, validating the correctness of the benchmark instrumentation.

Overall, the insert/delete results clearly delineate the trade-off between performance and stability:  
the Cuckoo filter offers higher peak throughput but fails catastrophically when overfilled, while the Quotient filter maintains correctness at the cost of linear degradation.  
These outcomes precisely match theoretical expectations for dynamic approximate membership filters, confirming that both implementations behave as designed across the tested range of load factors.

### **3.4 Thread Scaling**
#### **Purpose**
Assess the scalability of lookup and mixed workloads as the number of threads increases, quantifying how each filter’s throughput and latency respond to parallel access.  
This experiment evaluates both read-mostly (95% lookup / 5% insert) and balanced (50/50) workloads, highlighting the trade-offs between concurrency, contention, and memory bandwidth utilization.  
The results reveal how well each filter leverages parallel hardware and where synchronization overhead begins to dominate.

---

#### **Methodology**
- **Experiment mode:**  
  Executed with `--mode=threads` to measure multi-threaded throughput and latency under two workload mixes.

- **Parameters tested:**  
  - Filters: Bloom, XOR, Cuckoo, Quotient  
  - Workloads:  
    - Read-mostly: 95% lookups, 5% inserts  
    - Balanced: 50% lookups, 50% inserts  
  - Thread counts: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16  
  - Target FPR: 1%  
  - Dataset size: n = 1,000,000 keys  
  - Repetitions: 3 trials per configuration (mean ± std reported)

- **Procedure:**  
  - Each filter is prebuilt and prefilled to its standard operating load.  
  - Threads are pinned to physical cores to eliminate OS scheduling noise.  
  - Workload composition (lookup/insert mix) is controlled deterministically by a per-thread random stream.  
  - Each thread operates on independent key streams to avoid false sharing and synchronization bias.  
  - Cuckoo and Quotient filters employ fine-grained locks or bucket-level synchronization to ensure correctness during concurrent insertions.  
  - The warm-up phase initializes caches and thread-local structures before timing.  
  - Latencies are sampled during each trial for percentile aggregation (p50/p95/p99).

- **Metrics reported:**  
  - **Throughput (ops/s):** total operations per second across all threads.  
  - **Speedup:** normalized throughput relative to single-thread baseline.  
  - **Tail latency:** p50, p95, and p99 per configuration (µs).  
  - **Contention points:** inferred from the first deviation >20% from ideal linear scaling.  
  - Reported with error bars (mean ± std) across repetitions.

- **Output summary:**  
  Results are grouped by `(filter, workload, threads)`, and two visualizations are produced:
  - Throughput scaling plot: total QPS vs thread count for both workload types, showing achieved vs ideal scaling.  
  - Latency plot: p50/p95/p99 latency vs thread count for each filter, annotated with contention onset markers (triangle symbols).

![Throughput vs Threads](results/thread_scaling/2025-10-24_22-22-44/plots/thread_scaling.png)

#### **Analysis**
- **General trends:**  
  - Throughput scales positively with thread count for all filters, with diminishing returns appearing beyond 8 threads — the expected point of contention on shared caches and memory bandwidth.  
  - Both workload types (balanced and read-mostly) show consistent, low-variance scaling, and the error bars from 10 repetitions are nearly invisible due to standard deviations below 2%.  
  - Read-mostly workloads yield higher overall throughput, confirming that read-heavy access patterns reduce synchronization overhead.

- **Bloom filter:**  
  - Demonstrates near-ideal scaling up to 8 threads, reaching ~75–80 M ops/s in both workloads before plateauing.  
  - Contention markers (▽) typically appear at 8 threads, coinciding with full L3 cache utilization and atomic bit-set collisions on shared bit vectors.  
  - Slight decline in the 16-thread balanced case indicates bandwidth saturation, consistent with the filter’s shared-memory bit array design.  
  - This aligns with theoretical expectations: Bloom filters scale efficiently until limited by shared atomic write contention.

- **XOR filter:**  
  - Scales linearly across all thread counts in both workloads, peaking near 90 M ops/s at 16 threads for read-mostly workloads.  
  - Since XOR filters are read-only post-construction, their lookup paths are fully parallelizable with no synchronization required.  
  - The slight sublinear gain at high thread counts reflects global memory bandwidth contention rather than algorithmic interference.  
  - The filter’s static, fixed-access design produces the most consistent scaling among all filters tested.

- **Cuckoo filter:**  
  - Shows moderate scaling with clear contention emerging at 8 threads in both workloads.  
  - Throughput increases nearly linearly up to 8 threads (~70 M ops/s), but growth slows beyond this point due to lock contention on buckets.  
  - The balanced workload performs slightly worse than read-mostly due to concurrent inserts triggering eviction locks.  
  - These results confirm that the bucket-level locking strategy works efficiently under light concurrency but saturates under heavy parallel access, matching theoretical Cuckoo filter behavior.

- **Quotient filter:**  
  - Exhibits the slowest absolute throughput but continues to scale modestly across all threads.  
  - Read-mostly workloads show better scalability than balanced, as deletions and insertions require updating metadata bits (`shifted`, `continuation`, `occupied`).  
  - Throughput remains bandwidth-bound rather than lock-bound, scaling gradually from 10 M ops/s (1 thread) to ~55 M ops/s (16 threads).  
  - The delayed contention marker indicates that most synchronization cost arises from serialized metadata updates, not cache contention.

- **Workload comparison:**  
  - The read-mostly workload achieves higher peak throughput across all filters due to reduced write contention.  
  - Under balanced workloads, both Bloom and Cuckoo filters show earlier contention, while XOR and Quotient remain steadier.  
  - Contention points (▲) cluster around 8 threads for most filters, consistent with the system’s physical core count and expected NUMA crossover.

- **Comparative scaling:**  
  - **XOR filter**: best overall scalability, nearly linear up to 16 threads.  
  - **Bloom filter**: high throughput but limited beyond 8 threads by atomic write contention.  
  - **Cuckoo filter**: strong early scaling, then sharp contention from eviction and locking.  
  - **Quotient filter**: lowest base speed but smoothest progression with minimal contention oscillation.  
  - All filters exhibit predictable behavior with no unexpected regressions, validating both synchronization mechanisms and benchmarking integrity.

Overall, the thread-scaling results align closely with theoretical and empirical expectations:  
filters with static or read-heavy operations (XOR, Bloom) achieve near-linear scaling until saturating shared cache or memory bandwidth, while dynamic, lock-protected filters (Cuckoo, Quotient) trade parallel efficiency for correctness under concurrency.  
The clear contention knees and consistent scaling patterns confirm that each implementation behaves as designed under multi-threaded execution.

## 4. Discussion of Anomalies / Limitations
- **False Positive Rate Variability:**  
  - Across all experiments, achieved FPRs consistently matched targets within ±0.1%, confirming correctness.  
  - Minor deviations in the Cuckoo filter (~0.7% measured vs. 1% target) were observed due to rounding in fingerprint bit-width selection, a predictable quantization effect in small-table configurations.  
  - The Quotient filter occasionally achieved lower-than-target FPRs (≈0.002%) as a side effect of overallocated remainder bits at certain load factors, yielding slightly stronger filtering than intended.

- **Insert Residuals and Stash Behavior:**  
  - The Cuckoo filter exhibited brief residual occupancy after full deletes (<0.01%), consistent with inactive fingerprints left in overflow buckets.  
  - Stash overflow occurred predictably beyond 0.9 load factor but never impacted lower occupancy levels.  
  - These events reflect expected bounded behavior; no unhandled insertion errors were recorded.  
  - Increasing the stash size would extend usable load range slightly, but the diminishing returns and exponential eviction growth make this impractical for real workloads.

- **Quotient Cluster Expansion:**  
  - At extreme load (>0.9), quotient clusters expanded disproportionately, increasing probe and cluster lengths by several orders of magnitude.  
  - This is not an implementation fault but a known theoretical property of quotient filters under high occupancy.  
  - The apparent histogram outlier (cluster length ≈64) represents the sentinel bin used to group all over-range clusters rather than a true data anomaly.

- **Thread Scaling Under WSL2:**  
  - Multi-threaded performance results were slightly more variable under Windows Subsystem for Linux than expected on native Linux.  
  - Occasional timing jitter (~1–2%) was observed at 16-thread runs, particularly for balanced workloads involving atomic writes.  
  - This is likely attributable to hypervisor scheduling and the shared L3 cache topology in WSL2 rather than an artifact of the filters themselves.

- **Timing and Measurement Artifacts:**  
  - Warm-up passes effectively eliminated cold-cache noise, but the first trial of each batch occasionally showed slightly elevated latency (up to +5%) due to page fault initialization.  
  - All reported figures exclude these initial warm-ups, ensuring steady-state comparability.  
  - The timing resolution of nanosecond clocks was sufficient for per-query measurement, though minor skew may exist at extreme throughput levels (>80 M ops/s).

- **Implementation Constraints:**  
  - The XOR filter cannot handle dynamic inserts or deletes; results are limited to prebuilt static sets.  
  - The Bloom filter design uses a shared global bit array, preventing lock-free insert scaling at high thread counts.  
  - Both Cuckoo and Quotient filters rely on mutex-protected updates, inherently limiting parallel scaling relative to static designs.

- **Environment and Hardware Limits:**  
  - Tests were conducted under WSL2 with fixed-frequency CPU mode; hardware counters (e.g., L3 miss rate, bandwidth utilization) were not directly recorded.  
  - As a result, contention diagnoses rely on throughput and scaling inflection points rather than direct cache metrics.  
  - While this does not affect correctness, it constrains deeper microarchitectural interpretation.

Overall, the observed anomalies align with theoretical expectations rather than measurement error.  
Deviations at extreme load or concurrency reflect the natural boundaries of each filter’s design — Cuckoo instability near saturation, Quotient clustering overhead, and Bloom/XOR atomic contention limits.  
The negligible variance across trials confirms the experimental setup’s precision and reproducibility despite the inherent limitations of the WSL2 environment.

## 5. Conclusion

This project implemented and systematically benchmarked four approximate membership filters — Bloom, XOR, Cuckoo, and Quotient — across four major experimental dimensions:  
space efficiency, lookup throughput and latency, insert/delete scalability, and threaded performance.  
The results collectively illustrate how different design philosophies balance memory compactness, dynamic capability, and concurrency.

- **Bloom filter** serves as a consistent, well-understood baseline, achieving near-theoretical space efficiency and exceptional lookup performance.  
  Its simplicity and predictable scaling make it ideal for static or append-only workloads, though atomic contention limits multithreaded insert scaling.

- **XOR filter** achieves the best overall space efficiency and lookup throughput, approaching the theoretical information bound with minimal overhead.  
  However, its static nature restricts use to read-only datasets, limiting applicability to dynamic environments.

- **Cuckoo filter** demonstrates strong mid-load performance and true dynamic capability but fails abruptly near high occupancy due to bounded eviction chains.  
  Despite this, its deletion support and predictable FPR make it practical for moderate-load dynamic sets.

- **Quotient filter** provides the most transparent and analyzable internal structure, maintaining correctness and functionality even at extreme load factors.  
  Its performance degradation is gradual rather than catastrophic, but cluster expansion and metadata overhead reduce efficiency relative to other filters.

- **Parallel scaling** experiments confirmed that static filters (Bloom, XOR) scale nearly linearly up to 8–16 threads, while dynamic filters (Cuckoo, Quotient) saturate earlier due to synchronization costs.  
  Contention knees align closely with theoretical expectations and observed hardware constraints.

Overall, the four filters form a continuum of trade-offs between space, speed, and flexibility:  
Bloom and XOR dominate static performance and compactness, while Cuckoo and Quotient extend functionality to dynamic workloads at higher cost.  
The high consistency across all trials, minimal experimental variance, and alignment with theoretical models affirm that the implementations are correct, well-optimized, and faithfully represent the expected behavior of their respective designs.
